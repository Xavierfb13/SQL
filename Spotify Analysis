# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

-- What are the top 13 most popular songs that are under 3 minutes long?

SELECT track_name AS Song
,duration_ms / 60000 AS minutes 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE duration_ms <= '180000'
ORDER BY popularity DESC 
LIMIT 13;

-- What is the average tempo for songs sung by Olivia Rodrigo?

SELECT avg(tempo) As average_tempo
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Olivia Rodrigo';

-- What 5 songs have the least spoken words? 

SELECT artist_name
,track_name 
,speechiness
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE speechiness < 0.08133
ORDER BY speechiness 
LIMIT 5;
